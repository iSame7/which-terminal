# which-terminal
Configuring the terminal I use

- I use iTerm2 instead of the Stock terminal Mac app
- I use oh-my-zshell
- I use rbenv and rvm (on different computers - please only install one of them)
- I use Solarized Dark for the terminal colors
- I use powerline-shell to get those cool path bars. I usually hide the host name and the user, before running python ./setup.py install, edit the config file and comment out username, hostname
- I use the Meslo Powerline Font as you need a font that supports the directory characters for powerline
- I use z an amazing tool to quickly jump between projects. Like Alfred but for your Terminal reduced to folder search only
- I use the subl . command a lot to quickly open a specific folder in Sublime Text. This is what I use to edit my fastlane configuration
- echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc to stop installing docs every time you install a gem
- Settings -> Profiles -> Keys -> Load Preset -> Natural Text Editing
- Enable the Show proxy icon in window title bar option to show the folder on the window title bar for right click and drag & drop gestures
- Profiles -> Advanced -> Semantic History -> Open with editor... -> Sublime Text 3
- Keys -> Replace Cycle Tabs ... with Next Tab and Previous Tab
